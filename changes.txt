1.1
     - Remove 'counters' parameter for:
          EGreedyAgentFactory/SoftMaxAgentFactory/VDBEEGreedyAgentFactory.
       Those AgentFactory uses the mean model of the distribution used to
       initialize them instead of generating it through counters.
     - Add 'Formula' package. Provide management of formulas, obtained by
       combining operators, variables and constants (see 'Formula.h' for more
       details).
     - Complete header description for pointer management
       (if an object is passed by pointer, the destructor description will
       state if this object will be released in the process).
     - Modfied how the time is rendered in latex tables generated by
       'TinyBRL-export' (the time is rounded to make reading easier).
     - FormulaAgent added (only support formulas using 3 variables).
     - Add a new mode to 'TinyBRL-DDS' (--formula_set_generation).
       Used to generate a set of formulas (e.g. for FormulaAgent).
     - OPPS-DS modified to identify the best agent in a discrete set of
       FormulaAgent (defined through a set of formulas using 3 variables).

1.0.1
     - Memory optimization for 'TinyBRL-export'.
     - Minor bug fixed in Agents names.
       (BAMCPAgent/EGreedyAgent/SoftMaxAgent/VDBEEGreedyAgent)
     - Add support of short names for MDPDistributions
       (IMDPDistribution, MDPDistribution, DirMultiDistribution).
     - Add usage of short distribution names in AgentFactories.
       (EGreedyAgentFactory/SoftMaxAgentFactory/VDBEEGreedyAgentFactory)

1.0
     - Initial release
